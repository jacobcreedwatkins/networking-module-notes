Cyberspace Active Defense (CAD)
XX OCT 2023
Start Time: 1300
Duration: 4 hours

Type of Operation: Cyberspace Defense Design and Implementation

Objective: Due to the increase in attacks and all the work performed in support of the Gorgas Cyberspace Operations, your team has been assigned to develop a defensive strategy for implementation, and will implement signature based protections across their network and harden the host-level network protections. Once the measures are in place for each task, you will be required to demonstrate that they are functioning and normal traffic is still authorized.

Scenario Credentials: FLAG = i_am_filtering_your_noise

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Task 1
IPTables/NFTables - Host Filtering

You are required to Setup and Test all Rules, prior to implementing any DROP Policy as you may lose connection if improperly configured. Notify Mission Command(Instructor) if connections are dropped.

IPTable Rule Definitions for T1

IPTable Rule Definitions for T3

NFTable Rule Definitions for T2

Validation of IPTables and NFTables

Be sure to save your IPTables rules you will need them again in Task 3.

To save your IPTABLES rules: iptables-save > iptable.rules.

To save your NFTABLES rules: nft list ruleset > nft.rules.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Task 2
IPTables/NFTables - NAT

You are required to establishing NAT policies for T5 and T6 through the respective BLUE_HOST's they are attached to.

Prepare T1 for NAT Configurations

Change the Default Policy in the Filter Table for the INPUT, OUTPUT, and FORWARD chains to ACCEPT

Flush your current iptables rules.

Temporarily enable IPv4 forwarding using the /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward file

Prepare T5 for NAT Configurations

Ensure there is a Default GW entry present for 192.168.1.1

You can use sudo ip route replace default via 192.168.1.1


Prepare T2 for NAT Configurations

Change your chains to now have a policy of Accept

Flush your current nftables rules.

Temporarily enable IPv4 forwarding using the /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward file

Prepare T6 for NAT Configurations

Ensure there is a Default GW entry present for 192.168.3.1

You can use sudo ip route replace default via 192.168.3.1


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Task 3
Signatures

Gorgan Cyber Forces have captured targeted traffic related to specific Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) relating to Donovian Actors. They have stored the Traffic Capture on the Pivot:

/home/activity_resources/pcaps/ids.pcap

They have also provided the following syntax for utilizing Snort, their implemented IDS Signature solution:

sudo snort -D -i eth0 -l /var/log/snort/ -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tools/Techniques: Wireshark, TCPDump, Open Source Research (OSR)

Prior Approvals: The Gorgan Government has mandated that all protections are required to be tested and validated prior to Droping and/or Blocking any traffic. Seek any clarifying guidance from Mission Command(Instructor), and ensure approval is received prior to moving between the different tasks.
